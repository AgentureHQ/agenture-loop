# Feedback-loop infrastructure for autonomous task-level design


## Problem statement

Long-term goal: the agent completes task-level design without user interaction. To get there, we need a feedback loop that learns from escalation events (cases where the agent had to halt and ask user, captured as gap-logs by the escalation protocol). Without infrastructure to ingest, analyze, and feed back these events into rules and prompts, the agent cannot improve autonomously.

## Scope

In scope:
- Design a mechanism that ingests gap-log entries produced by the `task_escalation_protocol` feature.
- Mechanism surfaces patterns (e.g., "X% of escalations come from feature design lacking acceptance-criteria detail").
- Mechanism proposes targeted rule or prompt updates.
- Define a manual or semi-automated review-and-merge workflow for proposed updates.

Out of scope:
- Implementing this until `task_escalation_protocol` is live and gap-logs accumulate.
- Machine learning models. Initial version is a script + reporting template per KISS.

## Acceptance criteria

- Documented mechanism for analyzing escalation gap-logs exists.
- Mechanism surfaces actionable patterns from gap-log data.
- Mechanism proposes rule or prompt updates aimed at reducing escalation frequency.
- Review-and-merge workflow defined for proposed updates.

## Quality gates

- Approach reviewed with user before implementation begins.
- Depends on `task_escalation_protocol` feature being implemented and gap-logs accumulating.
- Initial version is a script + reporting template, not ML.
